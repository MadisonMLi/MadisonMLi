### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Madison, I graduated from University of Minnesota with a MS in Financial Mathematics and BS in Management Information Systems (Finance Minor).
My expertise lies in leveraging data analysis and quantitative models to enhance existing risk management frameworks. I am deeply passionate about applying these skills to address pressing social issues, particularly in the realms of AI and Education equity.
